For the purpose of our analysis, we need to feature out some unnecessary features from it. all variable of the raw data created_at id id_str text display_text_range source truncated in_reply_to_status_id in_reply_to_status_id_str in_reply_to_user_id in_reply_to_user_id_str in_reply_to_screen_name user geo coordinates place contributors is_quote_status extended_tweet quote_count reply_count retweet_count favorite_count entities favorited retweeted possibly_sensitive filter_level lang timestamp_ms extended_entities quoted_status_id quoted_status_id_str quoted_status quoted_status_permalink After careful selection, 7 columns are left in the data. Below is a table of the variable names. Selected variables from the raw data created_at id_str text geo user place extended_tweet The variables geo, user, place and extented_tweet contain a dataframe for each tweet, and each of the dataframe contains more specific information of the variable. For example, each tweet has a user variable, which is a dataframe that contains 40 columns of information of the user, including id, name, location, number of followers and so on. variables of user id id_str name screen_name location url description translator_type protected verified followers_count friends_count listed_count favourites_count statuses_count created_at utc_offset time_zone geo_enabled lang contributors_enabled is_translator profile_background_color profile_background_image_url profile_background_image_url_https profile_background_tile profile_link_color profile_sidebar_border_color profile_sidebar_fill_color profile_text_color profile_use_background_image profile_image_url profile_image_url_https default_profile default_profile_image following follow_request_sent notifications profile_banner_url We select id_str and followers_count from the user variable. And for other variables that contain one dataframe per tweet, we only choose one variable from each of them: select full_name from place, full_text from extended_tweet. If the tweet is longer than 140 characters, the tweet would be truncated to put into the text variable, and the original tweet would be put into the full_text variable. We add a new variable called original_text to restore the tweet and make constructing analysis more convenient. 3.2 extract words Next, we need to tokenize the word to make analysis related to property of words in each tweet.For this task, we use the tokenize_tweets() function from the tokenizers library, since there are some special characters like hashtag and usernames that might otherwise be stripped away using other tokenizer. Below is an example for how it tokenizes one of the tweets. ## [1] &quot;@cryptocevo Why #KISHU ?\\n$KISHU use for payments in websites, like Travala and NOWPayments team accept it&lt;U+0001F525&gt;\\nStreamers can get $KISHU donations for their Twitch streams and bloggers for youtube!\\n\\n@elonmusk @cz_binance @binance @HuobiGlobal @InuKishu @VitalikButerin\\n@chinapumpwxc https://t.co/2b8bGNgoAk&quot; ## [[1]] ## [1] &quot;@cryptocevo&quot; &quot;why&quot; &quot;#KISHU&quot; &quot;$kishu&quot; &quot;use&quot; &quot;for&quot; &quot;payments&quot; &quot;in&quot; &quot;websites&quot; ## [10] &quot;like&quot; &quot;travala&quot; &quot;and&quot; &quot;nowpayments&quot; &quot;team&quot; &quot;accept&quot; &quot;it&lt;U+0001F525&gt;&quot; &quot;streamers&quot; &quot;can&quot; ## [19] &quot;get&quot; &quot;$kishu&quot; &quot;donations&quot; &quot;for&quot; &quot;their&quot; &quot;twitch&quot; &quot;streams&quot; &quot;and&quot; &quot;bloggers&quot; ## [28] &quot;for&quot; &quot;youtube&quot; &quot;@elonmusk&quot; &quot;@czbinance&quot; &quot;@binance&quot; &quot;@HuobiGlobal&quot; &quot;@InuKishu&quot; &quot;@VitalikButerin&quot; &quot;@chinapumpwxc&quot; ## [37] &quot;https://t.co/2b8bGNgoAk&quot; 3.3 extract sentiments Before extracting sentiments from the tweets, we need to firstly clean the text such that it does not contain any special characters such as hashtags, @, website links, etc. In order to make our sentiment scores accurate, we need to make sure these special characters are not included. Below is a comparison between original text and the cleaned text. ## [1] &quot;@cryptocevo Why #KISHU ?\\n$KISHU use for payments in websites, like Travala and NOWPayments team accept it&lt;U+0001F525&gt;\\nStreamers can get $KISHU donations for their Twitch streams and bloggers for youtube!\\n\\n@elonmusk @cz_binance @binance @HuobiGlobal @InuKishu @VitalikButerin\\n@chinapumpwxc https://t.co/2b8bGNgoAk&quot; ## [1] &quot;cryptocevo Why KISHU ?\\n$KISHU use for payments in websites, like Travala and NOWPayments team accept it&lt;U+0001F525&gt;\\nStreamers can get $KISHU donations for their Twitch streams and bloggers for youtube!\\n\\nelonmusk cz_binance binance HuobiGlobal InuKishu VitalikButerin\\nchinapumpwxc &quot; We get the sentiment score for each tweet using the syuzhet method, which is a custom sentiment dictionary developed in the Nebraska Literary Lab. We then classify each sentence as neutral if the score =0, positive if score&gt;0, and negative if score&lt;0. 3.4 dataset variables summary Below is a table decribing all the variables we have for each tweet after data processing. variables descriptions created_at creation time of tweet id_str tweet id text truncated tweet of length&lt;140 geo coordinate of tweet user_id user id user_follower_count number of followers of user location location of tweet full_text full text of tweet original_text original text word_tokens a list of word tokens cleaned_text text after removing special characters sentiment_score sentiment scores sentiment sentiment of tweet: positive, neutral or negative "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Twitter Dataset", " Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Twitter Dataset By using Tweepy API, we monitored tweets data features related to keywords: Elon Musk, Tesla, @elonmusk for one month and decided to pick a continuous 7-day period for final evaluation. Here we use the data set collected on 10/28/2021. A total of 65,695 values were missed in 3 columns which are tweet_loc, user_loc and full_text. As shown in the table and the upset plot above, the tweet_loc column has the most missing values which only contains 4 valid values in total. By data description, it indicates that users seldom specify details about the location tagged in the Tweet. Another largely missing data column is user_loc with 683 non-null value. user_loc classify a Tweet by a specific place name such like Georgia, USA, and the missingness may be the similar reason as missingness of tweet_loc people dont tag their location when tweeting on topics about Elon Musk. Also, the missing values in column full_text shows that around half of the users tweet without text or making comments.
