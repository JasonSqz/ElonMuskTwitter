Here we use the data set collected on 10/28/2021. A total of 65,695 values were missed in 3 columns which are tweet_loc, user_loc and full_text. As shown in the table and the upset plot above, the tweet_loc column has the most missing values which only contains 4 valid values in total. By data description, it indicates that users seldom specify details about the location tagged in the Tweet. Another largely missing data column is user_loc with 683 non-null value. user_loc classify a Tweet by a specific place name such like ‘Georgia, USA’, and the missingness may be the similar reason as missingness of tweet_loc– people don’t tag their location when tweeting on topics about Elon Musk. Also, the missing values in column full_text shows that around half of the users only write short text when post tweets related to Elon Musk. When constructing analysis on these data, we are aware of the fact that most of tweet_loc and user_loc features are missing. We are interested in finding the possible correlation between the missingness and sentiment of the text, or if it is related to the length of the text.
