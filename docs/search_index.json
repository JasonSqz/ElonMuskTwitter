Besides all those miracles and innovations he made in his business empire, he forms a controversial figure on the Internet, especially with his appealing words on Twitter. Till Dec.¬†2021, he has owned 65.6M followers on Twitter as his 13th year of creating account. There is no doubt that Elon Musk is quite a social media influencer who tweets frequently everyday and expresses opinions on a variety of topics including: spaceX, crypto-currency, Tesla, etc.. Twitter users always have heated discussions surrounding his tweets and associated actions. Based on those facts, we are curious about how people react to Elon Musk‚Äôs Tweets. We want to visualize user discussions on related topics and explore underlying patterns using various techniques. In this project, we collected Twitter streaming data using Tweepy API for a continuous week starting from Nov.¬†28th, 2021. The tweets collected contain valuable information including: tweet content, user profile, and geological identification. For our analysis, NLP techniques will be applied to calculate the sentiments and classify topics on tweet contents. We consider to carry out analysis at both tweet level and user level and hopefully the geographic and time series information can help answer the following questions: What‚Äôs the volumes of users‚Äô tweet regarding Elon Musk over time? Is there a geological pattern for users discussing Elon Musk? For people who are influential (more followers), will there be a difference in attitude to average Twitter users? What are the most popular topics/the most frequent words in tweets about Elon Musk? For individual topics, what is the distribution of sentiments and what are the most frequent words?

"],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Dataset overview 2.2 Limitations", " Chapter 2 Data sources Our data was collected from Twitter using the Tweepy API. Since we are interested in Elon Musk. We chose the keyword set of ‚ÄúElon Musk‚Äù,‚Äúelonmusk‚Äù,‚Äú@elonmusk‚Äù,‚Äútesla‚Äù,‚ÄúTesla‚Äù. From October 28th to Novemeber 5th, we collected data 9 days in a row. For the purpose of this study, we choose to use data from October 28th to Novemeber 3rd, which is a 7-day period. During the period when our program was running, we capture every real-time tweets that contain any of the above keywords. The data is collected in the form of a tweet object, and it contains not only the text of the tweet, but other valuable information worth exploring. 2.1 Dataset overview After combining our dataset, we observed that a total of 471,996 tweets were collected. For a single tweet object, it contains 36 features. Below is a table of the features. Table 2.1: All Feature names all variable of the raw data created_at extended_tweet id quote_count id_str reply_count text retweet_count display_text_range favorite_count source entities truncated favorited in_reply_to_status_id retweeted in_reply_to_status_id_str filter_level in_reply_to_user_id lang in_reply_to_user_id_str timestamp_ms in_reply_to_screen_name quoted_status_id user quoted_status_id_str geo quoted_status coordinates quoted_status_permalink place possibly_sensitive contributors extended_tweet is_quote_status quote_count One thing worth mentioning is that some of features are actually dictionaries. For example, in User, there are actually 40 more sub features including username,location,description, etc.. Counting those sub features, there are over 150 features in a tweet object and we have to choose carefully from them. Details of selected features and descriptions will be elaborated in the data transformation section. 2.2 Limitations Since we do not have the resource to a cloud server, we were not able to run the program 24 hours every day in the period. Moreover, the start and end time for each date is different. We will need to find a overlapping period when conducting analysis relating to time. Another limitation is about a feature called ‚Äúconversation_id‚Äù. It builds up a conversation by capturing replies to a specific tweet. However, it has to be configured during the data collection phase and our dataset does not have it. We will try some other methods to construct a conversation. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Feature Selection 3.2 Tokenization 3.3 Sentiment 3.4 Summary of added features", " Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Feature Selection There are 35 features in the data set and more sub-features within a feature. After careful consideration, we chose 7 features to construct our data set for analysis. The following is a table describing all selected variables. Table 3.1: Feature Overview Features Description created_at creation time of tweet id_str tweet id text truncated tweet of length&lt;140 user_id user id followers_count number of followers of user location location of tweet full_text full text of tweet Of the 7 features, user_id and follower_count are sub-features from user. They captures the id and the number of followers of a user respectively. location is a sub-feature from place. It is a user-identified location, which they can put anything on it. full_text is a sub-feature from extended tweet. It captures tweets that has over 140 characters. We did not keep the feature geo as we found out that it has a missing percentage of almost 100 percent. It will show up in the missing value section to support out decision. After selecting our basic features, we notice that texts are stored in two different features. If the tweet is longer than 140 characters, the tweet would be truncated and put into text. The original tweet would be put into full_text.To make our analysis more convenient, we add a new variable called original_text to store the tweets 3.2 Tokenization Next, we conduct tokenization. This a process that will help us with other natural langauge processing analysis. Since there are some special characters like hashtag and usernames that might otherwise be stripped away using other tokenizer, we use the specific tokenize_tweets() function from the tokenizers library. Below is a demonstration for how it tokenizes one of the tweets. ## [1] &quot;@AGlobalCitizen @AlexanderBruyns @PPathole @elonmusk @SpaceX We would also somehow need to create some sort of artificial magnetic field around the entire planet to make sure that any biomass we take there isn&#39;t immediately destroyed by cosmic radiation&quot; ## [[1]] ## [1] &quot;@AGlobalCitizen&quot; &quot;@AlexanderBruyns&quot; &quot;@PPathole&quot; &quot;@elonmusk&quot; ## [5] &quot;@SpaceX&quot; &quot;we&quot; &quot;would&quot; &quot;also&quot; ## [9] &quot;somehow&quot; &quot;need&quot; &quot;to&quot; &quot;create&quot; ## [13] &quot;some&quot; &quot;sort&quot; &quot;of&quot; &quot;artificial&quot; ## [17] &quot;magnetic&quot; &quot;field&quot; &quot;around&quot; &quot;the&quot; ## [21] &quot;entire&quot; &quot;planet&quot; &quot;to&quot; &quot;make&quot; ## [25] &quot;sure&quot; &quot;that&quot; &quot;any&quot; &quot;biomass&quot; ## [29] &quot;we&quot; &quot;take&quot; &quot;there&quot; &quot;isnt&quot; ## [33] &quot;immediately&quot; &quot;destroyed&quot; &quot;by&quot; &quot;cosmic&quot; ## [37] &quot;radiation&quot; We then add word_tokens as a feature to our dataset. 3.3 Sentiment Tweets have sentiments and here we try to classify a tweet as positive, negative or netural. Before extracting sentiments from the tweets, we need to firstly clean the text such that it does not contain any special characters such as hashtags, ‚Äú\",‚Äù@\", website links, etc. Some special character might affect the accuracy of the sentiment score. Below is a comparison between original text and the cleaned text. Typically ‚Äú@‚Äù and website links are removed. After cleaning all the tweets, they were stored in a new feature cleaned_text in our dataset. ## [1] &quot;@elonmusk @ElemonGame Great ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è @Corsair will help @Elemongame the first blockchain game ever owns hundred millions users.

ElemonGame CORSAIR Elemon Corsair love ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüöÄüöÄüöÄ &quot; Now, we determine the sentiment score for each tweet using library ‚Äúsyuzhet‚Äù, which is a custom sentiment dictionary developed in the Nebraska Literary Lab.The sentiment scores are stored in a new feature sentiment_score. We then classify each tweet into three categories: positive(score&gt;0), neutral(socre=0), and negative(score&lt;0). We add sentiment as feature into our dataset to capture the sentiment category of a tweet. 3.4 Summary of added features We added 5 new features into the dataset after some processing, adding to a total of 12 features. Those new features will help us better conduct analysis and visualizations. Below is a table describing all added features. Table 3.2: Additional Feature Overview variables descriptions original_text original text word_tokens a list of word tokens cleaned_text text after removing special characters sentiment_score sentiment scores sentiment sentiment of tweet: positive, neutral, or negative "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Twitter Dataset", " Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Twitter Dataset We conducted analysis on the missing values before forming our final dataset. Of all the features, we first choose 8 features to consider. 7 out of the 8 features are introduced in the previous section, and the only feature that we left out is geo. The missing value graph will support our decision. Another thing worth mentioning is that all the added features will not be presented. Since they are dervied from text, and they will not contain any missing value. Here we use the whole raw data set containing tweets from October 28th to Novemeber 3rd. There are a total of 471,996 tweets. The following is a missing value graph of our raw dataset. We modified the feature names a bit to make sure the graph is clean. Table 4.1: Missing values Feature Count geo 471944 location 466755 full_text 277690 No.follower 56 tweet_id 56 As shown in the graph, the geo feature has the most missing values that is close to 100%. From the documentation, geo is the tweet location that is tagged by the user. It indicates that Twitter users seldom specify a location for tweets. Because of the high missing percentage, we choose to remove the feature. Another largely missing data column is location with 5241 valid values. location is a self-identified location by the user, and is has the format like ‚ÄòManhattan, NY‚Äô. We think that we will be able to derive some geological pattern based on the limited data we have. The missing value in text is interesting. text can only holds up to 140 character and if a tweet exceeds the limit, full_text is the feature that will capture the complete contents. We see that around half of the users write short text when post tweets related to Elon Musk. Looking at the missing patterns. More than a half of the tweets are missing geo and location, and around 46% of the tweets have additional missing value in full_text. The other three missing patterns are trivial. We do notice that there is a missing pattern that has missing value in every feature. We found out that there we 56 empty rows in our dataset and we removed those row manually. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Elon Musk 5.2 Volume of tweets 5.3 Geological Distribution 5.4 Tweet Contents", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Elon Musk Elon Musk is very active on twitter and anything he tweets can be very influential and brings a lot of controversies. For example, his tweet about the crypto-currency ‚Äúdogecoin‚Äù caused ‚Äúdogecoin‚Äù price to spike. Since Twitter users have many discussions surrounding him, our analysis aims to visualize those discussions. The period of which we collected our data was very interesting. It was shortly after Tesla flied in stock market and Elon Musk became the richest man in the world. He was also asked by the United Nation to donate 4% of his growing wealth to solve a hunger crisis. Just shortly after that, on Nov.¬†1st, he posted a Chinese poem ‚Äú‰∏ÉÊ≠•ËØó‚Äù titled as ‚ÄúHumankind‚Äù, which seems to be describing dogecoin and shiba inu coin. 5.2 Volume of tweets We first carried out analysis on the number of tweets that we collected each day. Due to some technical issues, the durations we collected tweets each day are different. They were about 10-12 hours each day, with one excepetion on Oct 29. On that day, we collected tweets for about 5.5 hours. In order to present a consistent results through the period, we standardize the tweets by dividing the total collected hour and multiplying by 24. The following graph presents expected number of tweets each day. From the graph, we see that the volume each day can be as low as 70 thousands and as high as 250 thousands. There were two peaks on Oct.¬†29th and Nov 1st. For the first peak, we corresponded it to the drastic increase in Tesla‚Äôs stock price. For the second peak, we related to the conversation between an United Nation offical and Elon Musk. We notice from below that this conversation has 337.5 thousand likes, showing its tremendous volume of attention. Observing these patterns, we conclude that controversial events associated with Elon Musk will cause an increase in discussion on Twitter. 5.3 Geological Distribution Even though we have limited data on geological information of users, we still want to make use of them to explore some patterns. In total we have 5293 tweets that contain a user geological information. The location is not limited to the United States, and we conducted filtering for each states. From the state graph, we can see that users mainly locate in four states. They are California, Texas, Florida, and New York, with 503, 336, 248, and 187 users respectively. Even though we have a fairly small sample, it still seems that users in more economically developed state tend to discuss more related to Elon Musk. 5.4 Tweet Contents Now, our analysis dive into the tweet-level. We are concerned with the contents of the tweets. Even though it is impossible for us to examine tweet by tweet, we use powerful Natural Language Processing techniques to explore patterns. 5.4.1 Word Frequency We first look at some most frequent words that appear across tweets. By inspecting the word frequency histogram and the word cloud, we can have some insight about what people were discussing inside these tweets. We can see that in the frequency graph that most of the words are related to crypto-currency. The word ‚Äúwill‚Äù and ‚Äúcan‚Äù have the most frequency. In relating to the topic of crypto-currency, we hypothesis the pattern to be Twitter users love to envision the future of crypto-currency and use ‚Äúwill‚Äù and ‚Äúcan‚Äù to express their expectations. The word cloud presents more words of high frequency. The words ‚Äúdoge‚Äù, ‚Äúbillym2k‚Äù and ‚Äúdogecoin‚Äù are in the top 15 words list, and they are describing the same object-dogecoin. Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency that are created as a ‚Äújoke‚Äù to make fun of the fact that everyone can copy bitcoin‚Äôs open source code and publish a new cryptocurrency. Elon Musk is a big supporter for dogecoin, calling it ‚Äúpeople‚Äôs crypto.‚Äù It is also unsurprising that these the words like ‚Äúbitcoin‚Äù, ‚Äúbinance‚Äù and ‚Äúcrypto‚Äù are frequent in the tweets since Elon Musk is a big fan of bitcoin. The username ‚ÄúDrEliDavid‚Äù and the word ‚Äúhunger‚Äù also appeared a lot. The story began in Oct.¬†30th when Dr.¬†Eli David shared an image of a CNN Business article with the headline: ‚Äú2% of Elon Musk‚Äôs wealth could solve world hunger, says director of UN food scarcity organization.‚Äù Elon Musk tweeted that he would sell Tesla stock if WFP can prove how his 6 billion dollar can solve world hunger. There were lots of online dialogue between the two sides since Musk‚Äôs request for spending to be published. We can also see ‚ÄúspaceX‚Äù and ‚Äúmars‚Äù as referring to his project of sending human to Mars. However,we can clearly these topics have less popularity. Another interesting finding is the use of emojis. The following is a table of top 5 emojis frequency. html { font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', 'Fira Sans', 'Droid Sans', Arial, sans-serif;

We are unsure if it is responding to the spaceX project, or if it is expectation on the price of crypto-currceny: ‚ÄúTo the moon üöÄ‚Äù. 5.4.2 Tweet sentiment Moving forward, we look at the sentiment of tweets and how the sentiment correlates with other features in our dataset. Previously, we have assigned a sentiment score for each tweet based on the usage of words and classify them into categories. In this section, we expand sentiment classification as follows: very positive(&gt;1.2),positive(0.2,1.2],neutral[-0.2,0.2], negative[-1.2,-0.2), and very negative(&lt;-1.2) in order to create more insightful observations. From the graph, we can see that the overall sentiment is very positive. Over 85% of the tweets are either neutral or positive. Neutral and positive tweets have similar percentage of 33%. Elon Musk presents to be very unorthdodox on Twitter, and other users seems to identify with his style. We then explore some correlations between sentiment scores and other features. Firstly we look at if the length of tweets would have some impacts on the sentiment. We can see a clear trend of increasing average sentiment as the tweet length grows. At around tweet length of 400, we see a pattern of slight decrease in average sentiment towards 0. We conclude that users are more likely to express positive emotions regarding Elon Musk as the tweet length increases. However, for tweets that are excessively long, the emotion tends to be more neutral and even negative. We then try to explore if there is a relationship between sentiment and number of followers. We can see that it is a fan shaped graph. The average sentiment score for average Twitter user is generally flat and does not have much fluctuation. However, for people who are more influential (more followers), their attitudes seems to vary. We conclude that while average Twitter users are generally favorable of Elon Musk, more influential users can have varying opinions towards Elon Musk. 5.4.3 Monitoring Topics After the exploration of words and sentiments, we want to further find out how those high frequencey vocabulary are related. To to this, we apply topic modeling(LDA). LDA is an unsupervised generative probabilistic model which, typically given the number of topics, allocates each word in a document to a specific topic. Click here to see an interactive LDA result in which we select 6 topics. There is a detail description on how to read the graph in the page. From the result, we roughly extract two topics. The first and second topic in the graph overlap. Based on the keywords ‚Äútesla‚Äù, ‚Äúworld‚Äù, ‚Äúhunger‚Äù,and ‚Äústock‚Äù, we think this is a general topic regarding the spike of Tesla stock and the conversation between Elon Musk and United Nation offical. The third, fourth, and fifth topics are close in distance. We see various crypto-currency keywords like ‚Äúbitcoin‚Äù, ‚Äúbinance‚Äù, ‚Äúeth‚Äù, etc.. Those topics are discussions focusing on crypto-currencies. For the sixth topic, even though it is far away from other topics, we still think it talks about crpypto currencies. We see keywords ‚Äúbuy‚Äù, ‚Äúhold‚Äù, and ‚Äúkishu‚Äù. Therefore, we capture two topics corresponding to the content of Elon Musk‚Äôs tweets. The first topic about Tesla and United Nation‚Äôs proposal constitute about 53% of all the discussions. The second topic about crypto-currency makes up about 47% all the discussion. Identifying these two topics, we filtered out tweets using keywords belonging to the categories. The sentiment comparision between the two topics is shown below. As ‚ÄúCrypto‚Äù is straightforward, ‚ÄúElon Musk‚Äù refers to the combined topic of Tesla stock and the hunger crisis event. From the graph we can see that sentiment on ‚ÄúCrypto‚Äù is exceedingly more positive than topic ‚ÄúElon Musk‚Äù.

We randomly select 1/100 of the original data-set which was collected from 10/28/2021 to 11/04/2021 within several specific time-slots. Based on the LLN, the newly organized data-set with features user_id, created_at, follower_count, sentiment_score, original_text, sentiment can still reflect the true distribution of the sentiment. You can find the data here under the data folder of our repo. 6.3 Instruction for using the map The plot is initialized with the sentiment score we get after NLP process with no default follower group and comment search specified. The y-axis gives the sentiment score of each comment with color blue reflecting positive and red reflecting negative attitudes. User can hover the mouse over a circle to see user id, tweet contents, and sentiment score in detail. User can search for exact words in the tweet content posted by Twitter users. For example, entering Tesla in the search bar and click go will give several data circles in the plot with more positive than negative. User can filter the comments based on the number of followers of the user. This function can be used together with the search function introduced above to present a customized distribution of comments. Notes: The x-axis indicates the date value which is not continuous because our datasets are not crawled and collected 24 hours each day. The score and sentiment results are completely based on the previous NLP process so there are still possibility of misclassification. Considering the density of the circles in the plot, move your mouse slowly to the low right part of the exact circle and wait for the tooltip. To reset the plot, please left the search bar empty and choose all for the filter, then click Go, and you will get a default plot like this: Reference: Obeservable: Search Sentiment Analysis of Billboard Top 100 Songs 2000-2018. https://observablehq.com/@vizbiz/search-sentiment-analysis-of-billboard-top-100-songs-2000-2 "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion After processing the raw data and applying some NLP techniques, we gained some insights to Elon Musk and his controversial reputation on Twitter. Looking at the volume of tweets regarding Elon Musk, we saw the increases in volume as controversial events associated with Elon Musk happens. For geological distribution of users, we were able to see that users center in economically more advanced states. We then analyzed the content of tweets. We discovered the most frequent vocabularies and the most prevalent emojis in tweets. Using sentiment analysis, we identified that a large proportion of tweets are either positive or neutral. Users are favoring Elon Musk‚Äôs remark on Twitter.Moreover, we discovered that the length of tweet and follower count of a user have some effect on the tweet sentiment. Through topic modeling, we were able to identify two large topics of crypto-currency and a combination of Tesla stock and conversation between Elon Musk and United Nation official. These two topics clearly corresponds with the events happening during the period, and users have heated discussion surrounding them. Lastly, filtering using the keywords belonging to each topic, we saw that users are favoring more on Elon Musk‚Äôs remark on crypto currency. Despite all these findings we mentioned in the result part above, there still exist limitations. For the data collection part, since we can only collect streaming data, it is unavoidable to have some time discontinuity in our data. From the time series perspective, this may introduce bias to our analysis. So the conclusions we reached till now are restricted to the specific time-slots. In future improvement, we want to better control the period during which we collect our data or possibly find a cloud server to mount our program. If we are able to derive a complete dataset, a more accurate analysis can be carried out using the same framework. In addition, we want to include conversation_id in the feature as it would make it much easier to construct a conversation. For example, we will be able to retrieve all tweets replying to the Chinese poem tweet. If so, we could carry out analysis on all corresponding replies and gain some insights into a specific topic with more accurate results. In conclusion, it was very effective to conduct analysis using Twitter data, and we were lucky to be collecting in this interesting period.
