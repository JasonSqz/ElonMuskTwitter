In this project, we collected Twitter streaming data using Tweepy API for a continuous week starting from Nov. 28th, 2021. The tweets collected contain valuable information including: tweet content, user profile, and geological identification. For our analysis, NLP techniques will be applied to calculate the sentiments and classify topics on tweet contents. We consider to carry out analysis at both tweet level and user level and hopefully the geographic and time series information can help answer the following questions:

- What's the volumes of users' tweet regarding Elon Musk over time?

- Is there a geological pattern for users discussing Elon Musk?

- For people who are influential (more followers), will there be a difference in attitude to average Twitter users?

- What are the most popular topics/the most frequent words in tweets about Elon Musk? What are the most frequently mentioned topics in tweets of negative or positive sentiment?

- For each individual topic, what is the distribution of sentiments and what are the most frequent words?
